# Dynamic Queue Configuration Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a dynamic queue system that automatically uses Redis or RabbitMQ based on the `QUEUE_CONNECTION` environment variable. This allows seamless switching between queue backends without code changes.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Horizon Configuration (`config/horizon.php`)
- Updated to use `env('QUEUE_CONNECTION', 'redis')` for dynamic connection selection
- Added support for both Redis and RabbitMQ wait time thresholds
- Horizon automatically adapts to the configured queue connection

### 2. Base Broadcast Event (`app/Events/BaseBroadcastEvent.php`)
- Created abstract base class for all broadcast events
- Automatically determines queue connection from environment
- Provides consistent queue configuration across all events

### 3. Updated Events
- **AchievementUnlocked**: Now extends `BaseBroadcastEvent`
- **BadgeUnlocked**: Now extends `BaseBroadcastEvent`
- Both events automatically use the configured queue connection

### 4. Enhanced Jobs
- **ProcessPurchaseEvent**: New job with dynamic queue connection support using `onConnection()` and `onQueue()` methods
- **ProcessCashbackPayment**: Updated with dynamic queue configuration using `onConnection()` and `onQueue()` methods
- All jobs automatically use the configured queue connection without property conflicts

### 5. Updated Listeners
- **ProcessLoyaltyRewards**: Enhanced with dynamic queue connection support
- Includes retry logic and proper error handling

### 6. LoyaltyService Refactoring
- Removed dependency on `MessageQueueService`
- Now uses `ProcessPurchaseEvent` job for better reliability
- Simplified architecture with Laravel's built-in job system

### 7. Queue Configuration Command
- Created `php artisan queue:config` command for easy switching
- Shows current configuration
- Allows switching between Redis and RabbitMQ

## Usage

### Switching Queue Connections
```bash
# Show current configuration
php artisan queue:config

# Switch to Redis
php artisan queue:config redis

# Switch to RabbitMQ
php artisan queue:config rabbitmq

# Restart Horizon after switching
php artisan horizon:terminate
php artisan horizon
```

### Environment Variables
```env
# For Redis (default)
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
CACHE_STORE=redis

# For RabbitMQ
QUEUE_CONNECTION=rabbitmq
CACHE_STORE=redis
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Redis Configuration
- Jobs dispatched successfully to Redis queue
- Horizon processes jobs from Redis
- Queue remains empty after processing (jobs completed)

### ✅ RabbitMQ Configuration
- Jobs dispatched successfully to RabbitMQ queue
- Horizon processes jobs from RabbitMQ
- Queue remains empty after processing (jobs completed)

### ✅ Complete Purchase Flow
- LoyaltyService processes purchases
- ProcessPurchaseEvent job dispatched
- PurchaseProcessed event triggered
- Achievement and badge processing works
- Real-time WebSocket updates function correctly

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Easy switching between Redis and RabbitMQ
2. **Reliability**: Uses Laravel's robust job system instead of custom queue logic
3. **Consistency**: All components automatically use the same queue connection
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized queue configuration
5. **Performance**: Optimized for both Redis and RabbitMQ backends

## Architecture Flow

```
Purchase → LoyaltyService → ProcessPurchaseEvent Job → 
PurchaseProcessed Event → ProcessLoyaltyRewards Listener → 
AchievementUnlocked/BadgeUnlocked Events → WebSocket → Client
```

All components automatically use the configured queue connection (Redis or RabbitMQ) without any code changes required.
